                    - It has been a busy few weeks for me since the academic
                    year came to a close in the middle of May. I had the
                    opportunity to travel to Shenzhen, China for the 2024 IEEE
                    World Congress on Services to present research that I had
                    conducted over the past year which was accepted for
                    publication in the proceedings of the international
                    conference on Quantum Software (QSW).

                    Over the past year, whilst also working towards completing
                    my degree at Newcastle University, I have had the pleasure
                    of working with two of my previous lecturers, Dr. Sadegh
                    Soudjani & Dr. Paolo Zuliani, as well as one of their PhD
                    students Marco Lewis on the uses of genetic algorithms for
                    quantum state preparation whilst also attempting to optimise
                    for T-Count. We trialled the developed solution on many
                    different quantum state preparation problems and the results
                    we found were more or less what were expected of this
                    method. One thing that was interesting to note that
                    unfortunately we didn't have time to evaluate more was the
                    potential ability for genetically generated solutions to be
                    more optimal after circuit transpilation compared with other
                    state preparation methods. For more information and to see

                    Overall, my first experience of performing and presenting
                    academic research has been incredibly insightful. The
                    lessons I have learned over the past year have helped
                    tremendously in other aspects of my academic career, in
                    particular my masters thesis. The guidance from Drs.
                    Soudjani and Zuliani, and Marco Lewis has been invaluable
                    and is something I will be able to carry going forward
                    hopefully within my career in quantum computing research.
