                    - One of my other hobbies, of which I have many, is
                    photography. I don't consider myself very adept at it but I
                    enjoy it immensely. Particularly when I take a trip out with
                    friends on dedicated excursions just to take pretty
                    pictures. It gives me time to focus on something that I can
                    control and it gives me immediate feedback on things I need
                    to tweak and change.
                    <br />
                    While this site was originally dedicated to my academic
                    career and my time at Newcastle University, I have decided
                    to upload some of the better photos to here as well as
                    posting them on
                    <a class="links inline-link" href="https://www.instagram.com/awright.dev/"
                        >instagram.</a
                    >
                    I have created a dedicated page for these and it can be
                    found <a class="links inline-link" href="../photography.html">here!</a>
                    I will hopefully remember to update the page with more shots
                    as and when I get them!
