                <p>
                    it's been a busy few weeks for me since the academic year
                    came to a close in the middle of may. i had the opportunity
                    to travel to shenzhen, china for the 2024 ieee world
                    congress on services to present research that i had
                    conducted over the past year which was accepted for
                    publication in the proceedings of the international
                    conference on quantum qoftware (qsw). over the past year,
                    whilst also working towards completing my degree at
                    newcastle university, i have had the pleasure of working
                    with two of my previous lecturers, dr. sadegh soudjani & dr.
                    paolo zuliani, as well as one of their phd students marco
                    lewis on the uses of genetic algorithms for quantum state
                    preparation whilst also attempting to optimise for t-count.
                    <br /><br />
                    we trialled the developed solution on many different quantum
                    state preparation problems and the results we found were
                    more or less what were expected of this method. one thing
                    that was interesting to note that unfortunately we didn't
                    have time to evaluate more was the potential ability for
                    genetically generated solutions to be more optimal after
                    circuit transpilation compared with other state preparation
                    methods. for more information and to see the paper in full

                    >
                    for a link to the arxiv version. overall, my first
                    experience of performing and presenting academic research
                    has been incredibly insightful. the lessons i have learned
                    over the past year have helped tremendously in other aspects
                    of my academic career, in particular my masters thesis. the
                    guidance from drs. soudjani and zuliani, and marco lewis has
                    been invaluable and is something i will be able to carry
                    going forward hopefully within my career in quantum
                    computing research.

                    ff there are any questions related to the paper or just my
                    general experiences, don't hesitate to e-mail me

                    thanks for reading, heres to hopefully one of many posts
                    about my research!
