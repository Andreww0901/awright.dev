                        It has been a busy few weeks for me since the academic
                        year came to a close in the middle of May. I had the
                        opportunity to travel to Shenzhen, China for the 2024
                        IEEE World Congress on Services to present research that
                        I had conducted over the past year which was accepted
                        for publication in the proceedings of the international
                        conference on Quantum Software (QSW).

                        Over the past year, whilst also working towards
                        completing my degree at Newcastle University, I have had
                        the pleasure of working with two of my previous
                        lecturers, Dr. Sadegh Soudjani & Dr. Paolo Zuliani, as
                        well as one of their PhD students Marco Lewis on the
                        uses of genetic algorithms for quantum state preparation
                        whilst also attempting to optimise for T-Count. We
                        trialled the developed solution on many different
                        quantum state preparation problems and the results we
                        found were more or less what were expected of this
                        method. One thing that was interesting to note that
                        unfortunately we didn't have time to evaluate more was
                        the potential ability for genetically generated
                        solutions to be more optimal after circuit transpilation
                        compared with other state preparation methods. For more

                        Overall, my first experience of performing and
                        presenting academic research has been incredibly
                        insightful. The lessons I have learned over the past
                        year have helped tremendously in other aspects of my
                        academic career, in particular my masters thesis. The
                        guidance from Drs. Soudjani and Zuliani, and Marco Lewis
                        has been invaluable and is something I will be able to
                        carry going forward hopefully within my career in
                        quantum computing research.
                        <br /><br />
                        If there are any questions related to the paper or just
                        my general experiences, don't hesitate to e-mail me

                        Thanks for reading, heres to hopefully one of many posts
                        about my research!
