                    <p class="post">
                        - After loosing my previous website to a catastrophic
                        failure a few months ago and my domain name pointing to
                        nothing ever since, I thought it was probably time to
                        get a page back up and running. I've completely started
                        from scratch this time and its hosted via GitHub pages.
                        No longer do I have to worry about programming routes in
                        Flask or the innevitable self hosting issues that come
                        with modWSGI. This is in no way a slight against Flask,
                        I personally think its great to use and quite powerful
                        for what it does, but for a simple static site such as
                        this, I simply had no need for it.
                        <br /><br />
                        Much like with my previous site, I want to post periodic
                        updates to this page in the hopes that it will sort of
                        become a natural reflection of my contributions to
                        society. It may also become a place where I just rant
                        and talk about random stuff that I find interesting!
                        <br /><br />
                        As you can see from the giant banner at the top of the
                        page, reminiscent of webpages from the early 2000s,
                        <a class="links inline-link" href="/"
                            >https://awright.dev</a
                        >
                        is still very much under construction and I hope to add
                        more to it over the coming months! So check back soon
                        for updates!
                    </p>
