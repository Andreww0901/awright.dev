                    - After losing my previous website to a catastrophic failure
                    a few months ago and my domain name pointing to nothing ever
                    since, I thought it was probably time to get a page back up
                    and running. I've completely started from scratch this time
                    and its hosted via GitHub pages. No longer do I have to
                    worry about programming routes in Flask or the innevitable
                    self hosting issues that come with modWSGI. This is in no

                    - It has been a busy few weeks for me since the academic
                    year came to a close in the middle of May. I had the
                    opportunity to travel to the 2024 IEEE World Congress on
                    Services in Shenzhen, China, to present some research that I
                    had conducted over the past year which was accepted for
