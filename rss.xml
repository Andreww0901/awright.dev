        It has been a busy few weeks for me since the academic
        year came to a close in the middle of May. I had the
        opportunity to travel to Shenzhen, China for the 2024 IEEE
        World Congress on Services to present research that I had
        conducted over the past year which was accepted for
        publication in the proceedings of the international
        conference on Quantum Software (QSW).
    &lt;/p&gt;

        Over the past year, whilst also working towards completing
        my degree at Newcastle University, I have had the pleasure
        of working with two of my previous lecturers, Dr. Sadegh
        Soudjani &amp; Dr. Paolo Zuliani, as well as one of their PhD
        students Marco Lewis on the uses of genetic algorithms for
        quantum state preparation whilst also attempting to optimise
        for T-Count. We trialled the developed solution on many
        different quantum state preparation problems and the results
        we found were more or less what were expected of this
        method. One thing that was interesting to note that
        unfortunately we didn't have time to evaluate more was the
        potential ability for genetically generated solutions to be
        more optimal after circuit transpilation compared with other
        state preparation methods. For more information and to see

        Overall, my first experience of performing and presenting
        academic research has been incredibly insightful. The
        lessons I have learned over the past year have helped
        tremendously in other aspects of my academic career, in
        particular my masters thesis. The guidance from Drs.
        Soudjani and Zuliani, and Marco Lewis has been invaluable
        and is something I will be able to carry going forward
        hopefully within my career in quantum computing research.

        Thanks for reading, here's to hopefully one of many posts
        about my research!
